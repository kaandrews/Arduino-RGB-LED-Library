# Arduino-RGB-LED-Library
A library that provides many different ways to control an RGB LED connected to an Arduino.  My first attempt at object oriented programming on the Arduino.

Easiest way to use the library is to download the RGBLED.zip file and add to the Arduino IDE using Sketch -> Include Library -> Add ZIP Library...

The RGBLED folder shows the content of the ZIP file.

The RGBLED library is designed to control and RGB LED that is connected to 3 PWM pins of an Arduino.  The library allows you to do the following:

 - Turn the LED on and off
 
 - Flash the LED
 
 - Set the flashing speed
 
 - Fade gradually between 2 colours
 
 - Set the speed of colour fading
 
 - Pulse the LED
 
 - Set the speed of pulsing
 
 - Change colour immediately
 
 - Set to white with a specified colour temperature
 
 - Set the brightness of the LED
 
The example sketch allows you to try out some of these, by default it will cycle through the colours of the rainbow.

This library is probably overkill for most purposes but might be useful for learning.
